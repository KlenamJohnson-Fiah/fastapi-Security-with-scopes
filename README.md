# fastapi-Security-with-scopes

THIS IS PURELY AN EXPERIMENTAL WORK TO TEST AN IDEA I HAD>
THE IDEA HAD TO DO WITH STORING SCOPES IN A DB FOR EACH USER AND USING THEM IN OAUTH.

THIS FAILED AS I WASN"T ABLE TO ACHEIVE MY DESIRED RESULT. I WASN'T GOING TO GET BOGGED DOWN BY THIS.
ON TO THE NEXT EXPERIMENT.

HAPPY COMPUTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
